To enhance administration capabilities, we have introduced a score filter feature. This allows administrators to filter student scores based on specific criteria, such as score ranges or individual student names.

This feature is particularly useful for quickly identifying students who may need additional support or recognition based on their performance, streamlining the process of managing student assessments and feedback.
